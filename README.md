# The Sparks Foundation : Data Science and Business analytics Internship (GRIP)

Task-1-Prediction-using-Supervised-Learning
Here I have created the prediction using simple linear regression where I have predicted the marks of a student based on the number of study hours of that student.

Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

● You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool

● Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?


Task-2-Prediction-using-Unsupervised-ML
Here I have created the prediction model using the Unsupervised ML and I have predicted the model using the K means Clustering

From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

● Use R or Python or perform this task
