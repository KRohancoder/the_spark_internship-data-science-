# The Sparks Foundation : Data Science and Business analytics Internship (GRIP)

🎯 Task-1-Prediction-using-Supervised-Learning
Here I have created the prediction using simple linear regression where I have predicted the marks of a student based on the number of study hours of that student.

Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.

● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.

● You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool

● Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data

● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?


● Task-2-Prediction-using-Unsupervised-ML
Here I have created the prediction model using the Unsupervised ML and I have predicted the model using the K means Clustering

From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

● Use R or Python or perform this task

● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

● Task-3-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Retail
Here I have created the analysis model of a Super market datasheet given by the company and have deployed the parameters successfully.

Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’

● As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit.

● What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data?

● You can choose any of the tool of your choice (Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS)

● Dataset: https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl


● Task-4-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Terrorism
Here in this project I have analysed the huge dataset of Terrorism where all the details are being provided

Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism

(Level - Intermediate)

● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’

● As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism.

● What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA?

● You can choose any of the tool of your choice

(Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS)

● Dataset: https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5

●Task 5 - Prediction-using-Decision-Tree-Algorithm
Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm of the iris dataset

● Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.

● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

●Task-6-Stock-Market-Prediction
Here I have created the model of Stock Market Prediction using the TensorFlow Modelling

Objective: Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of news headlines

● Stock to analyze and predict - SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX)

● Download historical stock prices from finance.yahoo.com

● Download textual (news) data from https://bit.ly/36fFPI6

● Use either R or Python, or both for separate analysis and then combine the findings to create a hybrid model

● You are free to select a different stock to analyze and news dataset as well while not changing the objective of the task.
